# June 20-21, 2016

MacDevOps:YVR is the best place for Mac Admins interested in integrating DevOps in their IT practice. Learn about Open Source projects in the MacDevOps community and find out how to get involved.

In 2015, we packed 11 sessions and 14 speakers in a full day of learning and sharing. This year we are expanding to two days and we want you there with us.

The event kicks off promptly at 8:30AM on Monday June 20th. (Continental breakfast service starting at 7:30AM).
